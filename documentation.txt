nsh: a simple shell

nsh may be ran:
	As an interactive shell by calling it with no arguments.
	On a script by providing the script name as the first argument.

nsh supports the basic shell as well as:
	Comments
	Multiple pipes
	

Known issues:
	commands that normally require the use of singlequotes '' for arguments will not be parsed correctly with them.
		for most cases, providing the argument without the singlequote will typically result in the command being run as expected
		Example: 
			find /usr/bin/ | 'sed s:.*/::' | grep -i '^a' > ../out1bash.txt ## will not be parsed/ran correctly
			find /usr/bin/ | sed s:.*/:: | grep -i ^a > ../out1bash.txt ## will be parsed and will output the same as bash
